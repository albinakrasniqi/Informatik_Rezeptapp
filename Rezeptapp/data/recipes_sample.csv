***Update*** Based on the review I wanted to let you know what I took out of the original recipe - it called for 1/2 c sliced olives. I was thinking if you want a really strong flavor - try a very Zesty Italian Dressing or saute your chicken with garlic and add chopped onions to the final dish.  Maybe that would perk it up for those that like things a bit spicier. The original way is a method in which my kids will eat it but I understand how adults may want a bit more zing.***","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/27/67/50/picyBkONm.jpg""",Vegetable,"c(""< 30 Mins"", ""Beginner Cook"", ""Easy"")","c(""2"", ""2"", ""1"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"")","c(""farfalle pasta"", ""fresh broccoli florets"", ""grape tomatoes"", ""light cheddar cheese"", ""monterey jack cheese"", ""parmesan cheese"")",4.0,3.0,500.1,17.4,5.4,99.0,512.5,41.2,2.3,2.5,42.3,4.0,,"c(""Cook pasta according to directions."", ""Add broccoli to the cooking water of the pasta during the last 4 minutes of the pasta cooking time."", ""Drain pasta and broccoli."", ""Toss chicken, tomatoes, dressing, monterey and cheddar cheese together in a large salad bowl."", ""Add pasta mixture; mixing lightly."", ""Sprinkle top with parmesan cheese."")"

Added 07.21.12  &quot;Why is it called a pie?&quot;, and &quot;Why the name 'Boston'?&quot;. Why &quot;pie&quot; instead of &quot;cake?&quot;,  probably because colonists baked  cakes in pie tins as they did not own cake pans. As far as the name Boston Cream Pie, story began when a New York newspaper in 1855 published a recipe for a 'Pudding Pie Cake'. Recipe was similar to the Boston Cream Pie recipe of today except that it had a powdered sugar topping.  In Boston,  Harvey D. Parker opened a restaurant called Parker House Restaurant.

Her photo is true food art. She urges baker to use mineral water instead of regular water. Soda water is carbonated, which makes it an artificial drink while mineral water naturally has carbon dioxide in it with lots of minerals.  Recipe does not mention a second rising after shaping which I find interesting.  Other filling possibilities might be---olive paste, goat cheese and dill,  maybe even a potato.  The 40 buns is based on a two bite size, but you could make them bigger if you want.  I have the impression that they keep well.

302290,Baked Salmon,832359,Shanlynn,PT30M,PT25M,PT55M,2008-05-06T01:29:00Z,"This is a very healthy recipe I concocted several years ago when I was told to start eating only fish and chicken, and was told to cut back on pretty much everything I loved, so it was done out of necessity. My husband came home with a giant salmon, and this is what we did with it.  It turned out great, and we love it now!  

I posted this on another site, and it's gotten great reviews.  A few people thought it needed more seasonings, but the seasonings everyone loves are what I love and had to cut out of my diet...as in salt!

You can substitute the brown rice for white rice, cous cous, or anything you like.  

You can also use chicken broth for the rice, and white wine is very good in the bottom of the pan if you're not watching what you eat.

To make it a one dish meal, you can add fresh asparagus during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time, and cover with foil.

I just rinse it well and slice it into thin'ish' slices. It is easy to core and peel pears! I have even done it while on the phone with a girlfriend! Core pears. I use a melon baller and start at the bottom and rotate the melon baller into the bottom starting at that little part where the stem comes out of the bottom. Leave the stem at the top! Clean out all the seeds. Then with a vegetable peeler or a paring knife  starting at the bottom peel all the skin off leaving the stem.
